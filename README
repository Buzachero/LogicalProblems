BINARY TREE PROBLEM
-----------------------------------------------
Imagine a binary tree like below:

		 1
   2		   3
4	  5     6     7 

Given a node in this tree, a sum of its subsequents nodes is required to be calculated.

EXAMPLES
Node 2:
4 + 5 = 9 
Node 3:
6 + 7 = 13
Node 4:
0 (no node under node 4)

NUMBER CALCULATION PROBLEM
-----------------------------------------------
Given two numbers A and B. A number C is required, but the following assumptions must be attended:
- 1st digit of number A is the 1st digit of number C;
- 1st digit of number B is the 2nd digit of number C;
- 2nd digit of number A is the 3rd digit of number C;
- 2nd digit of number B is the 4th digit of number C;
- and so on...

- If one of the number has higher amount of digits, so the surplus digits should be copied to number C

- If output of number C is greater than 1000000, so the value of number C is -1

EXAMPLES
number A = 1245
number B = 1111
number C = 11214151 > 1000000
So, number C = -1

number A = 58
number B = 1478
number C = 518478 ( < 1000000)

MATRIX DIFFENCE OF SUM DIAGONALS CALCULATION PROBLEM
----------------------------------------------------
Given a matrix N x N, it is required to calculate the difference between the sum of its diagonal

EXAMPLE
Matrix = 
[ 1, 2, 3
  4, 5, 6, 
  7, 8, 9 ]
 Diagonal1 : 1 + 5 + 9 = 15
 Diagonal2 : 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
 Difference = Diagonal1 - Diagonal2
 Difference = 0
